### Description

Back in 2017 I came up with an algorithm for calculating PAYE using Python. So while I was thinking about simple project ideas for my gitHub account I came across the script on my PC and decided to build this React App. 

Here is the script file [src/pfunctions/calculatePaye.js](https://github.com/goamoth/payecalculator/blob/master/src/pfunctions/calculatePaye.js)

So basically this is a simple React App for calculating PAYE from a gross income. I have created this using TDD method with Jest and tried to write all the necessary tests needed. 

Please note that this is far from perfect and I will be improving it as time goes by. Any suggestions on improving it further are also welcome... It might help someone somewhere.

Thank you!
